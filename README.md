Adjust AMD GPU fan speeds according to card temperatures.
Note that this script is intended to be run routinely from root's crontab.

Set your TARGET temperature for all GPUs. If mining, this will realistically be on a scale from
50 to 70 degrees Celcius according to the temperatures you will put up with and the noise you
will put up with.
